   Notes for translators, please read before starting.
  
   If you read this thank you for considering localising Pandoras Creatures.
   Before you start consider messaging me (Mod Author) or one of my Discord moderators,
   so you can get the Translator Role and have access to the newest lang file.
   This lang file will often have localisations for the next version of the Mod,
   that contains content that has not been released yet.
  
   When the localisation file is done send it to me, preferably in the discord channel made
   for it, or by sending me a direct message.
  
   If you want a name other then your Discord name to be inside the credits, let me know.

   By putting \n in the text the Mod will split the text at that position, when spliting text
   keep in mind that you have to add a color code again, if you used one in the line before
   (see color codes bellow), as its a new line and the color will reset itself to default.
  
   The following color codes can be added to the start of text to color it:
  
   #c0 Black
   #c1 Dark Blue
   #c2 Dark Green
   #c3 Dark Aqua
   #c4 Dark Red
   #c5 Dark Purple
   #c6 Gold
   #c7 Gray
   #c8 Dark Gray
   #c9 Blue
   #ca Green
   #cb Aqua
   #cc Red
   #cd Light Purple
   #ce Yellow
   #cf White
  
   The following color codes can be added to the start of text to apply some effects:
  
   #cl Bold
   #cm Strikethrough
   #cn Underline
   #co Italic
   #cr Reset the default color
  
   Feel free to add or remove new lines, in order to make the text look good in the language youre working on.
   You should use a text editor that has JSON formating in order to avoid invalid files.
   The text %s will be replace with text. Example: "Author: %s" could become "Author: andrew0030".  
   The text %d will be replace with a number. Example: "Radius: %d*%d*%d" could become "Radius: 3*3*3"
  
   IMPORTANT: The [Localising Tools] will only work on the Item Tooltips Category, as the ingame chat splits
   lines on its own when needed, and the colors are not meant to be changed!
  
   That's all have "fun" translating!
